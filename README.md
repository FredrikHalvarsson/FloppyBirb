# FloppyBirb

This is a simple Floppy Birb game implemented in C# as a console application using design patterns for better maintainability and extensibility.

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Singleton**: Used for the `Game` class to ensure only one instance of the game is created.
2. **Factory Method**: Used for creating `Pipe` objects.
3. **Strategy**: Used for the birb's movement behavior.

4. ## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Build and run the project.

## Controls

- Press `Space` to make the birb flop.
- Press `Escape` to quit the game.

Enjoy the game!
